 Welcome to my humble page. Do not fear! There is no XSS not tcp capture.
 All files are clean and made by me....well at least 75%. That other 25% is AI and books.

**Cover letter for employers**<br>

I’m a problem-solver who loves finding efficient solutions. I enjoy interacting with people and
providing excellent customer service in English, Finnish, and Estonian. I’m a team player, but I’m
also comfortable working independently. I’m organized, efficient, and always eager to learn new
things.
I have experience with user support, Active Directory, software installation, and ticketing
systems like JIRA. I’m skilled in troubleshooting, functional testing, and bug reporting. I’ve even filed bug
reports for popular PC games! I’m also familiar with AWS Cloud Computing.

About Cyber Security: I have many Cisco certs about cyber security and I have finished cyber security courses from Metropolia and Laurea University. 

About myself:
I am very positive and have CAN-DO attitude. I take user security very seriously. In several places where I have worked, I have been one of the best workers in the company. I like to earn trust by working and giving high quality work to my employers or clients. I accept criticism and can improve in a short time. I have logical critical thinking and never bring emotions to workplace. I like to talk with people about AI and cyber security. Also I am proficient in singing opera and using AI in my daily life.  (Not talking about ChatGPT) :) .

I currently am getting Linux Administrator and Ansible certificate from  Red Hat Academy. Building also chatbot web application in React and hosting server in Linode. I use debloating software, that I wrote for Windows. I am quite good of detecting fraud , phishing and scams. 

If you really read this cover letter then, my situation is bad. I want to work and I want to stay in one company as long as possible. I am loyal and trustworthy. I have no idea why companies won’t even get me an interview. I did an CV and AI sorting  analyze  and found that AI can’t read my CV. Many times it has given me very odd titels like:”People’s Management”, “Communication Designer” :D
And I have no idea where AI takes them. It is funny but very bad for me.

Thank you for reading and have a nice day.

### **My brief History**<br>

**`Born in the former Soviet Union (Estonia), within the Iron Curtain, I was the only one who envisioned the future. No one believed me and laughed at my ideas. In 1990, I heard the Finnish National Anthem and felt a surge of warmth and hope. It was illegal to listen to music other than Soviet Union propaganda. My father and uncle modified radio signals to reach Helsinki, and we secretly tuned into the Yle radio station at midnight every night to catch the Finnish Hymn. In those moments, I held onto my belief in humanity.`**<br>
**`When I was 12, I had a dream where I invented something that changed the world. Upon waking up, I tried desperately to remember what it was and sketched it out. Then, I realized that I couldn't jump if I hadn't learned to walk and run first. From that moment on, I aspired to become the best artist possible. I studied, learned, and practiced daily until I was the top artist in my school.`**

**`I'm also passionate about sports. Why can't someone be both intelligent and athletic? To jump, I first needed to master walking and running. So, I joined the Track & Field club. I trained rigorously every day and eventually achieved the ability to jump high and long. My primary events were long jump and triple jump. My personal best is 7.31 meters in the long jump and 14.30 meters in the triple jump. I accomplished my goal. I became the National Champion in 2007 and a European runner-up. You see, hard work truly pays off.`** <br>

**`When I moved to Finland, I began working as a low-level cleaner. My duties included cleaning up after deceased individuals, cleaning abandoned apartments, washing windows, and waxing floors. I made a promise to myself: "Even if I'm a cleaner, I'll be the best cleaner in Helsinki!" Seven years later, I achieved that goal. I received invitations from government institutions and renowned Finnish companies to wax their floors and clean their windows.`**

**`Simultaneously, while cleaning, I developed a passion for learning opera. Despite having no formal musical education, I started practicing and learning from books and videos. I attended choir performances and rehearsals. After five years of dedicated opera training, I successfully organized my own public opera concert. Additionally, I was accepted as a bass 2 opera singer in the Musiikkitalo (Music House) opera choir.`**<br>

**NOW**<br>

**Now, I'm embarking on a journey to learn cybersecurity and coding. Even if people doubt my potential or hesitate to hire me, I'm determined to become one of the best professionals in the field. Human potential is boundless. Limitations only exist within the social environment created by those who fear success or are resistant to unconventional thinking.**<br>
