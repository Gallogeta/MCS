**History**<br>
Born in former Soviet Union, inside the iron curtain, I was the only one who saw the furture. Nobody belived me and laughed at me. On 1990 I heard Finnish National Hymn and I felt warmth and hope. It was illegal to listen other music than Soviet Union music. My father and uncle modified radio signals to reach Helsinki and we cought every night at 00.00 Yle radio station Finnish Hymn. In these moments I belived in humanity.<br>
When I was 12, I saw a dream where I invented something that changed the world. When waking up I tried to remember what it was and tried to draw it. Then I understood that I can't jump if I haven't learned to walk and run first. After that I wanted to draw as proficienly as possible. I learned and studied, practiced every day until I was the best artist in my school.<br>
I love sport also. __(What? Can't I be smart and sporty??)__ First to jump, I needed to learn how to walk and run. So I joined Track & Field club. I trained so hard every day and eventually I was able to jump high and long. So my main was long jump and triple jump. My personal record is 7m.31cm and triple jump 14m.30cm. I made it. I am National Champion of 2007. And European second. SO you see hard work always pays. <br>
When I moved in Finland, I started working as a low level cleaner. Dead bodies, dead apartments, windows, floor waxing etc. I said to myself:"Even if im a cleaner, i'll be the best cleaner in Helsinki!" 7 years later, I am. I got invites from goverment institutes and popular companies in Finland to wax their floors or clean windows.<br>
Same time, when I was cleaning, I wanted to learn how to sing opera. I had no musical education. So I started practicing and learning from books and videos. Went to see choirs and choir practicies. After 5 years of training opera I managed to hold my own public Opera Concert and I was takes and a Bass 2 operas singer in Musiikkitalo (Music House) opera choir.<br>
**NOW**<br>
Now I am going to learn cyber security and coding. Even, if people don't see my potensial or are afraid to hire me, I'll be one of the best professionals. Human potensial has no limits. Limits are only in social enviroment made by those who ddon't want me to succeed or are just afraid out-of-the-box thinking.
